# Racial Bias in Criminal Justice Visualized: Code Black

By ... [Teddy Xinyuan Chen](https://teddysc.me) ...

## Inspiration

I (Teddy) attended a Black History Month event focused on `soul foods` on campus and was inspired to make more people learn a little bit more about how being black is like in the US. The team decided to go for systemmatic bias against black in the society, esp. in the criminal justice system and around machine learning models. That's why we made this to visually show the racial bias in the models when it comes to predicting recividism rate among black and the general population.
